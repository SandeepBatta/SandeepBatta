### 👋 Hey there, I’m **Sandeep Batta**

I’m a **Data Engineer** who just wrapped up my **`Master’s in Data Science`** *(May 2025)* from **`Indiana University Bloomington`**. Over the past few years, I’ve been on a mission to make data systems **smarter**, **faster**, and way less chaotic.

### 🛠️ What I *Love* Doing

- ⚡ Designing **end-to-end ETL pipelines** that handle scale *`(PySpark, Redshift, BigQuery)`*
- 🌩️ Building **event-driven systems** on **AWS & GCP** – Chatbots, data APIs, you name it
- 🧠 Mixing **AI with creativity** (trained a custom model to generate origami art from prompts)
- 🗺️ Crafting **visual stories from geospatial data** (yep, even for museums)
